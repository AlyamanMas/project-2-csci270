| 0.00 | 4.72 |  Hi friends, my name is Triss and this is no baller plate focusing on fast technical videos. |
| 4.72 | 8.08 |  I'd like to talk today about two techniques that have helped me in my career as a programmer |
| 8.08 | 10.48 |  that you might be surprised to hear about. |
| 10.48 | 12.48 |  Meditation and yoga. |
| 12.48 | 16.44 |  I talked a bit about this subject in a bad old video, but I'm going to do it properly today. |
| 16.44 | 18.72 |  I'll start with meditation. |
| 18.72 | 21.64 |  As ever, everything you see in this video from the script to the images are part of a |
| 21.64 | 25.40 |  marketing document available on GitHub under a public domain license. |
| 25.40 | 28.88 |  As coders, we are used to distractions coming from everywhere. |
| 28.88 | 31.16 |  Email, Slack, Twitter, Mastered on Reddit. |
| 31.16 | 33.04 |  The list is infinite. |
| 33.04 | 36.80 |  But there's an important invisible distraction that we rarely talk about. |
| 36.80 | 40.32 |  Our own thoughts, daydreams, zoning out. |
| 40.32 | 43.16 |  They don't come from the outside, they come from within. |
| 43.16 | 47.44 |  You can't simply put on headphones and disconnect from them or uninstall an app. |
| 47.44 | 50.28 |  Let me tell you my experience with meditation. |
| 50.28 | 54.68 |  For the first two months of 2017, I studied Kung Fu at a Dauist Temple at the top of a mountain |
| 54.68 | 56.12 |  in Central China. |
| 56.12 | 59.56 |  We got up at 6am every day in the freezing cold or snow. |
| 59.56 | 61.84 |  Practice chigong exercises to warm up the body. |
| 61.84 | 65.56 |  A simple breakfast of rice and vegetables grown at the temple. |
| 65.56 | 67.76 |  Practice Kung Fu and Tai Chi all morning. |
| 67.76 | 68.76 |  Had lunch? |
| 68.76 | 70.00 |  It was only this fancy once, by the way. |
| 70.00 | 72.64 |  I never learned what occasion we were celebrating. |
| 72.64 | 75.32 |  Then more training in the temple that the town was built around. |
| 75.32 | 77.28 |  Spot me in black at the back. |
| 77.28 | 79.92 |  Then dinner followed by Dauist study and meditation. |
| 80.20 | 84.80 |  I wasn't very good at the Dauist study, but really enjoyed the meditation. |
| 84.80 | 85.80 |  Anti. |
| 85.80 | 90.60 |  In our one day off per week, I took my camera sightseeing and or slept for 24 hours, |
| 90.60 | 92.60 |  depending on how brutal the training would be. |
| 92.60 | 97.24 |  And when I returned home, I kept up the meditation practice and switched from chigong to yoga, |
| 97.24 | 100.52 |  which serves a similar purpose, but is easier to find classes for. |
| 100.52 | 103.92 |  Dauists meditate, Buddhists meditate. |
| 103.92 | 109.12 |  All societies have some kind of quiet reflection practice baked into their rituals. |
| 109.12 | 111.24 |  Why is this so ubiquitous? |
| 111.24 | 115.48 |  Might it be because it is very useful, perhaps, essential to the human experience? |
| 115.48 | 118.60 |  Voltaire, the Enlightenment writer and thinker thought so. |
| 118.60 | 120.36 |  Einstein thought so too. |
| 120.36 | 122.48 |  Let's talk about your brain. |
| 122.48 | 126.40 |  There's an interesting phenomenon that I discovered almost immediately upon practicing |
| 126.40 | 127.40 |  meditation. |
| 127.40 | 132.40 |  My internal identity of self that, voice in my head, I think of as me, couldn't control |
| 132.40 | 135.32 |  the distracting thoughts, at least at first. |
| 135.32 | 139.96 |  My revelation, which I understand is a common one in meditation beginners, was, if my |
| 139.96 | 144.96 |  thoughts were external to my self, where did they come from, if not me? |
| 144.96 | 148.40 |  The answer is, perhaps, that there are two selves in our brains. |
| 148.40 | 152.28 |  A self that has the thoughts and a self that listens to them. |
| 152.28 | 155.92 |  Meditation strengthens the listening self, the part of you that acts as your willpower |
| 155.92 | 158.12 |  and is the executor of your agency. |
| 158.12 | 160.72 |  Let's go back to those exercises I did at 6am. |
| 160.72 | 165.28 |  The reason Dauists do chigong is to strengthen the body's core for the simple reason that |
| 165.28 | 169.96 |  allows you to sit in meditation comfortably for longer than if your body were weak. |
| 169.96 | 171.80 |  Yoga's roots are the same. |
| 171.80 | 176.40 |  It's widely believed that yoga is designed to complement the main goal of life, to meditate |
| 176.40 | 177.80 |  and achieve enlightenment. |
| 177.80 | 182.80 |  Yoga's goals of sitting comfortably for long periods of time match my own goals as a |
| 182.80 | 187.36 |  coder, sitting programming for long periods of time or gaming. |
| 187.36 | 192.16 |  We all know people who can just sit anywhere on the floor tucked up in any chair, cross-legged |
| 192.16 | 195.16 |  or kneeling, seemingly for an indefinite period of time. |
| 195.20 | 198.32 |  If you are not this kind of person, you can learn it. |
| 198.32 | 203.12 |  If you can sit comfortably, you don't need a standing desk or a fancy chair or treadmill |
| 203.12 | 207.32 |  desk or any of the expensive nonsense I personally have tried in the past. |
| 207.32 | 212.36 |  If you practice yoga just a little each day or do a longer practice at least once a week, |
| 212.36 | 216.24 |  in my experience, much discomfort is alleviated. |
| 216.24 | 220.02 |  Coders are a group that are highly aligned to an exercise that allows you to sit for long |
| 220.02 | 224.40 |  periods of time and a practice that sharpens the mind against distractions and increases |
| 224.40 | 225.40 |  focus. |
| 225.40 | 230.08 |  Yoga and meditation should be part of every coder's toolkit, just as a good editor, |
| 230.08 | 232.40 |  language or OS is. |
| 232.40 | 233.40 |  What are you waiting for? |
| 233.40 | 235.44 |  There's yoga classes everywhere. |
| 235.44 | 236.44 |  Try Ashtanga. |
| 236.44 | 241.52 |  That's my favourite because it's reassuringly the same, whatever class or book you choose. |
| 241.52 | 244.08 |  This is the book I own and recommend, by the way. |
| 244.08 | 249.16 |  You need hardly any equipment or space to do yoga, and you need no equipment or space |
| 249.16 | 250.60 |  to meditate. |
| 250.60 | 254.36 |  Try reading practicals and I've read a lot of good books introducing meditation and |
| 254.36 | 256.36 |  this one is my favourite. |
| 256.36 | 258.48 |  Friends, it's time to get healthy. |
| 258.48 | 259.56 |  See you next time. |

(Our teacher, Master Yuan)
Meditation is the dissolution of
thoughts in eternal awareness or pure
consciousness without objectification,

knowing without thinking, merging
finitude in infinity.

—Voltaire
The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and
the rational mind is a faithful servant.
We have created a society that honours
the servant and has forgotten the gift.
