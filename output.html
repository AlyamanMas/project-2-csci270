(Our teacher, Master Yuan)
Meditation is the dissolution of
thoughts in eternal awareness or pure
consciousness without objectification,

knowing without thinking, merging
finitude in infinity.

—Voltaire
The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and
the rational mind is a faithful servant.
We have created a society that honours
the servant and has forgotten the gift.
